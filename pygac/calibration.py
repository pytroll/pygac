    # > for the reflective channels 1, 2 and 3A. In order to improve the radiometric resolution of the
    # > instrument for low reflectance targets, the dynamic range of the instrument was divided equally
    # > in two ranges, i.e. nominally from 0 to 500 counts and from 500 to 1,000 counts. For channels 1
    # > and 2 half of the available Digital Number (DN) range is assigned to the low albedo range from
    # > 0 to 25% with the other half to the high albedo range from 26 to 100%. This allows for an increase
    # > in the radiometric resolution for dark targets. For channel 3A, the split between low and high
    # > albedo range is set at 12.5% albedo (Rao and Sullivan 2001).
    # The gain factors are given by the ratio of the fraction of albedo range to the fraction of count range
    # for the given count region. From the information given by the book quote, we get

    # Step 2. The radiance NBB sensed in each thermal AVHRR channel from the internal blackbody

    # Step 3. Output from the two in-orbit calibration targets is used to compute a linear estimate of
    # the Earth scene radiance NE. Each scanline, the AVHRR views the internal blackbody target and
    # outputs 10 count values for each of the three thermal channel detectors; these are found in words
    # 23 to 52 in the HRPT data stream. When the AVHRR views cold space, 10 counts from each of
    # the five channel sensors are output and placed into words 52 to 102. (Table 4.1.3-1 describes
    # how these data are multiplexed.) Count values for each channel are averaged together to smooth
    # our random noise; often counts from five consecutive scanlines are averaged because it takes five
    # lines to obtain a set of all four PRT measurements. The average blackbody count CBB and the
    # average space count CS, together with blackbody radiance NBB and space radiance NS, explained
    # in the next paragraph, are used to compute the linear radiance estimate NLIN,
    # NLIN = NS + (NBB - NS)*(CS - CE)/(CS - CBB)    (7.1.2.4-5)
    # where CE is the AVHRR count output when it views one of the reference Earth targets.
    # While the detector in channel 3B has a linear response, the Mercury-Cadmium-Telluride detectors used
    # for channels 4 and 5 have a nonlinear response to incoming radiance. Pre-launch laboratory measurements show that:
    #     a. scene radiance is a slightly nonlinear (quadratic) function of AVHRR output count,
    #     b. the nonlinearity depends on the AVHRR operating temperature.
    # It is assumed that the nonlinear response will persist in orbit. For the NOAA KLM series of
    # satellites, NESDIS uses a radiance-based nonlinear correction method. In this method, the linear
    # radiance estimate is first computed using a non-zero radiance of space, the NS term in Equation
    # 7.1.2.4-5. Then, the linear radiance value is input into a quadratic equation to generate the
    # nonlinear radiance correction NCOR:
    # NCOR = b0 + b1*NLIN + b2*NLIN^2    (7.1.2.4-6)
    # Finally, the Earth scene radiance is obtained by adding NCOR to NLIN
    # NE = NLIN + NCOR

    # Note: For channel 3B, the non-linear correction coefficients are set to zero to use the same equation.
    Nlin = nS + (nBB - nS)*(cS - cE)/(cS - cBB)
    Ncor = np.polynomial.polynomial.polyval(Nlin, b[0:3], tensor=False)
    Ne = Nlin + Ncor

    # Step 4. Data users often convert the computed Earth scene radiance value NE into an equivalent
    # blackbody temperature TE. This temperature is defined by simple inverting the steps used to
    # calculate the radiance NE sensed by an AVHRR channel from an emitting blackbody at a
    # temperature TE. The two-step process is:
    # TsE = c2*nu_c / ln(1 + (c1*nu_c^3/NE))    (7.1.2.4-8)
    # TE = (TsE - A)/B    (7.1.2.4-9)
